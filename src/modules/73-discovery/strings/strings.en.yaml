whatIsNetworkMap: What is a network map?
networkMapDescription: A network map is a visual representation of the relationships and dependencies between different services or components in a system. It provides an easy-to-understand overview of how different parts of a system interact with each other to deliver a specific functionality or service.
howToCreateNetworkMap: How to create a network Map?
howToCreateNetworkMapDesc: There are 3 simple steps to create a network map. 1. Select a Kubernetes connector to your target cluster and we will automatically discover the services and their dependencies on the cluster. 2. Select the services that you would like to add to network map. 3. [optional] Configure customized relations between the services.
whatIsServiceDiscovery: What is Service Discovery and how it works?
whatIsServiceDiscoveryDesc: Service Discovery is the automatic detection and monitoring of services running in your Kubernetes clusters, which will help the team gain insights on their applications, infrastructure, and logs. Simply enable Service Discovery on your existing Kubernetes connector to start using this feature!
